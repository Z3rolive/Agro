    Tomato plants prefer particular growing conditions, and they grow best when given proper care. 
1.	Dig a hole twice the diameter and depth of the tomato root ball.
2.	Place a small handful of all-purpose organic fertilizer or compost into the hole.
3.	Plant the tomato transplant up to its two top-most set of leaves.
Roots will form along the buried stem.
So soon after you transplant, you have to decide which trellising method to use:
•	Staking: Drive a wooden or metal stake into the ground next to the tomato transplant. Fasten the main trunk of the tomato to the stake with plastic ties.
•	Caging: Insert a three-ringed metal cage into the soil around your tomato transplant. Keep branches inside the cage as the plant grows.

To keep tomato plants vigorous, remove extra side branches. When these suckers are 3 to 4 inches long, remove them by pinching them out or by cutting them back to the main stem with scissors.
Fertilizing
Side-dress your tomato plants with a complete organic fertilizer, such as 5-5-5. Apply the first side-dressing when the tomatoes are golf-ball sized, and then side-dress every three weeks.
Use fertilizers with lower rates of nitrogen; higher rates cause tomato plants to sport lots of dark green leaves and produce few tomatoes.
Tomatoes need 1 inch of water a week, but they may need more in areas with hot, dry, windy summers.
Eliminating pests 
Here are a few insects that are a problem with tomatoes:
•	Tomato hornworm: These huge, green caterpillars, which sometimes grow to 4 inches long, have a horn-like “tail.” A few hungry hornworms can devastate a tomato plant quickly. If you see a hornworm that has what looks like grains of rice stuck on it, leave it alone! The “rice grains” are actually the cocoons of its natural enemy, a parasitic wasp.
•	Tomato fruitworm: This green, 1-inch-long caterpillar with white or yellow stripes feeds on foliage and fruits. They can be handpicked from plants.
•	Stink bug: These 1/2-inch-long gray or green shield-shaped insects primarily feed on fruits, causing hard, white or yellow spots on the tomato skin. To control stink bugs, keep your garden weed-free.

            """Dig straight, shallow trenches, 2 to 3 feet apart, in prepared soil. Plant seed potatoes 12 inches apart and cover with about 3 inches of soil. When the shoots reach 10 to 12 inches tall, use a hoe or shovel to scoop soil from between rows and mound it against the plants, burying the stems halfway. Repeat as needed through the growing season to keep the tubers covered.
Unlike container gardening, there's nothing to buy or build and no soil to transport. This is a simple, inexpensive, and proven method that farmers have used for millennia. It's practical for large-scale plantings, also.
However, the quality of the soil may limit the yield. In places where the dirt badly compacted or low in organic matter, an above-ground technique might work better.

        Modern Rice Farming Techniques For Farmers
Climate Requirement for Rice Farming
Rice farming requires 20°C to 40°C temperature throughout the life period of the crop.
Soil Requirement for Rice Farming
Rice farming can be done on a different variety of soil like as silts, loams, gravels, acidic and alkaline soils.The deep fertile clayey (rich in organic matter) and loamy soils are considered as an ideal soil or growing rice crop.
Various Rice Cultivation Methods
Drilling method
In this drilling method sowing of seeds and land, Ploughing can be taken by only two persons. This rice sowing method is generally confined to peninsular of The India.
Transplantation method
In this method first of all paddy seeds are cultivated in a nursery. After five weeks you can get the rice seedlings and it is ready for the transplanted in the main field. This method requires more labor and inputs. This is the best yield method for rice farming.
Rice Seeds Variety & Information For Rice Farming
The Farmers who want to start the Rice farming but they have not idea about the Rice Seed Variety. Don’t Worry, read this following information about Rice Seeds.
Seed selection plays the main role in rice cultivation for getting the better yield of the crop. You must select the best quality seeds of rice for getting the good seedlings.
•	The selected rice seed should be well grown, fully mature and plump in size.
•	Rice seed should be clean and exempted from the mixtures of other seeds.
•	The selected seeds have a high capacity for getting higher yields of a rice crop.
•	The selected rice seeds should not be stored in a bad storage.
•	Must apply Agrosan 100 gm/50 Kg of seeds for preventing seed-borne 
Land Preparation For Rice Cultivation
There are basically three methods for land preparation in rice cultivation. The dry, semi-dry and Wet.
•	Dry and Semi-dry system
These two systems require good tilth land. Before sowing and planting uniformly apply farm yard manure (FMY)/compost for 2 weeks to 4 weeks. In this dry and semi-dry system seed should be sown by the drilling or broadcasting method. In drill sowing method row to row space is 20 cm to 25 cm.
The dry and semi-dry system seed should be sown by the drilling or broadcasting method. The Drill Sowing method row to row space is 20 cm to 25 cm.

•	Wet system For Rice Farming
In wet cultivation system rice crops are grown by rain or irrigation and require the abundant water supply. This system has some mandatory formats like the land must be plowed thoroughly with 3cm to 5 cm of stable water puddle.
In clay soils and clay loamy soils, the ideal depth of puddle is found around the 10 cm.
After paddling the land should be level by equal distribution of water and fertilizers. In the wet system, paddy seeds cultivate after sprouting or rice seedlings are transplanted in the main field.
The rice Crops farming requires abundant water supply mostly in wetlands system During the initial period.

    Document(title: "Maize", imgUrl: "assets/corn.png", contents: """
        Maize is an expensive crop to grow, costing around £300/acre, so getting it right and achieving good yields are important.
Step 1: Field selection
Altitude: Wherever the crop is grown above 140m there must be other factors to favour of growing at this height, such south-facing and free-draining soil.
Soil type: Maize needs a dry soil in the spring, but not a soil type that will dry out too much in late spring when the young plants are developing.
Very free-draining and light, sandy soils can be too extreme.
Step 2: Seed-bed preparation
The aim is to achieve a deep, loose seed-bed. Maize is a free-rooting plant so there needs to be no restriction on root development in the early stages.
 Step 3: Drilling and sowing
Maize seed should be drilled to a uniform depth and into moisture. Soil temperatures should by 8C first thing in the morning for four to five consecutive days for maize to grow. 
The last 10 days of April should see all maize drilled, but climate will obviously depend on location.
Step 4: Choosing a variety
This should be based on experience of what has already been grown or what is being grown successfully on farms where conditions are similar. A modest target is 49.9t/ha (20t/acre) fresh weight. Always select a variety that has the potential to give the level of maturity needed by the end of October.
Step 5: Weed control
Once drilled, all fields should receive a pre-emergent herbicide to combat weeds.
This will also mean post-emergence herbicides have less work to do.
Step 6: Crop nutrition
Nitrogen is the driver and a lot of crops just don’t get enough because of an over-estimation of what the slurry can provide.
Maize requires:
o	180kg/ha of potash
o	40kg/ha of phosphate
o	And 150kg/ha of Nitrogen
Step 7: Pests and diseases
Insecticide dressings can be applied at drilling and there is a fungicide dressing to prevent rotting of the newly drilled seed.
These dressings break down after 21 days so there can be a risk where there is slow emergence of seed in cold, wet seed-beds."""),

        Grow A Lemon Tree from Seeds
Step 1. Moisten the soil so that it is damp all the way through, and then fill the planting pot to about an inch below the rim.

Step 2. Cut open lemon and remove a seed. Simply suck on it, but do not let it dry the seed must remain moist when it’s buried.

Step 3. Plant it about half an inch down in the middle of the pot, and then seal the soil directly above it with a light spray of water.

Step 4. Cover the pot with clear plastic wrap, seal the edges, and poke small holes in the top before placing it in direct sunlight. (Remember to keep hydrating. Never let the soil dry out, but don’t spray too heavily, either.)
About two weeks later, a seedling will emerge. Take the plastic covering off, but continue to keep the soil damp. Make sure the young plant gets eight full hours of light per day and interment doses of organic fertilizer as needed.
When the plant outgrows its planting pot, put it in the seedling pot and make sure to repeat the steps above. Older plants need less water than their younger counterparts but do keep the soil moist and fertilized nonetheless.
After their third year, healthy lemon trees begin to produce fruit. One that happens, a tree can yield a harvest consistently every year under the right climate and soil conditions. After a tree stars blossoming, it takes 4-12 months before a harvest, which usually takes place between summer and winter.

    Female and male flowers do not grow on the same tree, so you must have male and female trees in the garden.
Climate
•	Papayas grow best in hot areas.
•	They can tolerate mild frost if they are protected from cold winds.
Soil requirements
•	They can grow in most kinds of soil, but it must be well drained.
•	The roots can get diseases if the soil stays too wet.
•	Loamy soils are best.
Planting date
Papayas can be planted at any time of the year, but preferably in late summer.
Spacing
Plant papayas 1,5 metres between plants and
3 to 4 metres between rows.

Growing papayas from seeds
It is easy to grow the ordinary papaya tree from seed.
•	Wash the seeds from a ripe papaya.
•	Squeeze the seeds from the jelly bag that covers each seed. The seeds will only grow if you remove the bag.
•	Dry them in a shady place.
•	Store in a tightly closed container and keep them until December.
•	Plant the seeds in December. Put 5 seeds to a hole. Do not put any compost or manure into the holes.
•	Keep the small plants moist.
Planting
•	Dig a hole about twice the size of the bag in which the young tree is growing.
•	Remove the soil from the hole and add some compost and manure. Mix this with some of the soil that has been dug out.
•	Take the plant out of the container. If it is a plastic container you just cut it open at the side.
•	Do not disturb the roots.
•	Place the tree in the centre of the hole. When you fill up the hole hold the tree so that its base is level with the surrounding ground.
•	Raise the soil around the tree to dam the water (rain or irrigation).
•	Do not plant the tree deeper than it was in the container.
•	Do not cover the stem with soil because it will rot.
Water
•	Papayas need little water.
•	They will, however, give more and bigger fruit if they are watered every 2 weeks in the dry season. The flowers will drop if they do not get enough water.
•	If they are planted in clay soils, make sure that the soil does not stay too wet.
•	To avoid waterlogging in clay soil, make a ridge and plant the papayas on the ridge.
Fertilization
Compost or manure
Give the tree:
•	1 bucketful in September,
•	1 bucketful in November
•	another bucketful in January.
•	Sprinkle a few handfuls of manure evenly around the tree each month from September to the end of March.
